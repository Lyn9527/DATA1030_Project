# DATA1030_Project
# Student Mental Health Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict students' mental health, specifically their **Depression Scores**, using a dataset of academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline that identifies key contributors to mental health outcomes and provides actionable insights for early intervention. The project focuses primarily on a regression approach to predict depression scores, which are scaled from 0 to 5.

The repository includes:
1. Data preprocessing steps.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations.
3. Machine learning pipelines for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
4. SHAP value analysis for feature importance.

## Requirements
To ensure reproducibility, the project was developed using **Python 3.10** and the following package versions:

### Required Packages
| Package      | Version |
|--------------|---------|
| numpy        | 1.26.4  |
| matplotlib   | 3.9.2   |
| sklearn      | 1.5.1   |
| pandas       | 2.2.2   |
| xgboost      | 2.1.1   |
| shap         | 0.45.1  |
| plotly       | 5.23.0  |


## Running the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded and preprocessed according to the pipeline.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Run the provided scripts to visualize and analyze the data.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Use the pipeline to train, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning models.
4. **Global and Local Feature Importance Analysis**: Visualize local and global feature importance using different techniques.

All scripts are modularized and can be executed sequentially for a smooth workflow.
